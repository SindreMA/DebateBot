# DebateBot - A Discord bot for debates

## Description

This is a bot that mutest all people in a voicechannel, then unmutes them one by one to let them speak. It is intended to be used for debates.

## Why?

I got asked by some random people on reddit to make it for a community which they were mod/admin in. I thought it was a fun idea, so I did it. I wanted to learn how to make discord bots, and wanted my work to be used, not just coding to code.

Once i were done with the bot, they ghosted me and i've never heard anything from them since.
